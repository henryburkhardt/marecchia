Scott Fitzgerald. Earlier this morning Marrechia staff were informed that Fitzgerald had come in close contact with vials containing the previously covered ASR Covid variant, and became infected shortly after. The virus has since been contained but Fitzgerald, unfortunately, experienced an extremely severe case. SPA\u2019s invaluable in-house epidemiologist provided scientific insight, noting that \u201chis record-breaking age of 126 years may have contributed to his extreme symptoms and untimely passing.\u201d Shortly after his death, students also learned Fitzgerald was completely unvaccinated due to his incredibly short (second) life span. The Marrechia\u2019s thoughts and prayers go out to the Human Physiology class and loyal fans of Fitzgerald. A vigil will be held next week where members of the English department will participate in an all-night simultaneous out-loud reading of the Great Gatsby. The service will be held off SPA property, due to his disciplinary status of \u201cformally expelled.\u201d The Human Physiology elective faculty are currently looking into the possibility of resurrecting Fitzgerald a second time.

This year, the addition of a second lunch line was good in theory but has done little to ease long waiting times. In times like these, drastic actions must sometimes be taken. One solution recently proposed is the Trough Feeding System. The Marecchia spoke to the student (who preferred to remain anonymous) who made the idea and he explained it simply as a \u201crevolutionary liquid-based community-style feeding solution, where each lunch would be liquified in a blender and then poured into large communal style troughs.\u201d He added that \u201cstraws would, of course, be provided to each student.\u201d While the idea has faced some pushback because of how it treats children like farm animals, the anonymous founder noted that this might be outweighed by the fact that, \u201cthe entire school could literally eat lunch in the span of 10 minutes.\u201d The idea also has the advantage of treating all students equally (everyone would get the same time in the trough, and the same diameter straw). This is especially refreshing after the recent propagation of ideas like the GPA-based food system and the Underclassmen Just Don\u2019t Get Lunch philosophy. The founder is pushing for a pilot trough feeding program to serve as a proof of concept for the plan and has opened a volunteer sign-up list. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the school isn\u2019t ready for this revolution, but I truly believe troughs are the future of consumption.\u201d "},{"id":3,"blogCategory":"News","blogTitle":"Mike Pence anounce visit to SPA during X-Period next Thursday","slug":"","postedOn":"March 2, 2022","author":"Marecchia Staff","blogImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/V20200729DS-0340_%2850167142363%29.jpg/1200px-V20200729DS-0340_%2850167142363%29.jpg?20200923175055","imageCredit":"Wikimedia Commons, Fair Use Image","blogText":"Last week, after overwhelming requests from the student body former Vice President Mike Pence has announced his intention to visit SPA next Thursday.
