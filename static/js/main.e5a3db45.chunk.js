Pence will be speaking on the Ukraine-Russia crisis and also his role in undermining democracy throughout his time in the White House. One student the Marecchia spoke to said, \u201cthe amount of support from the student body is incredible. We love Mike Pence as an institution, so it\'s really cool that he\u2019s finally agreed to come speak to us.\u201d Students are encouraged to participate in a Q&A after his talk but the Pence team has discouraged any questions \u201cabout to the election or honestly anything political or anything to do with how he refers to his wife as \u2018Mother,\u2019\u201d as all of these are sore topics for him.
