      "blogText": "To build hype for the upcoming prom, SAC announced another spirit week, the climax of which will be a Weezer concert in Huss. One student the Marecchia spoke to said, “nobody likes Weezer. I hate Weezer. Nobody listens to them.” While student reactions may be mixed, the concert will still have an academic benefit. The Ancient World History elective will be attending the concert to “learn about one of the darkest periods in modern music history.”  Upon hearing the news of the concert, one misguided student said to the Marecchia “Oh cool, I like Weezer.” The Marecchia staff has reached out to the health office to provide counseling for the student. Mike Pence, who will be visiting campus later this week, declined Weezers offer to join the performance citing his previously scheduled task hand counting every vote cast in the state of Georgia."
